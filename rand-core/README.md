rand-core
====

Core functionality for the [rand] library.

This crate contains the core trait, `RngCore`, and some extension traits. This
should be sufficient for libraries publishing an `RngCore` implementation,
but most users should prefer to use the [rand] crate.
Most parts of this crate are re-exported in [rand].
